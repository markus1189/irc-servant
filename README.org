Toy example for an irc bot in haskell, in addition to playing with
GHC's ~PatternSynonyms~.

Inspired by [[https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/icelandj/Pattern%2520synonyms][an fpcomplete article]].

Usage: ~irc-servant <master> <channel>...~ (master is the one the bot
accepts commands from initially)


Commands (*must* start with '> '):
- say hello
- what time is it?
- get lost
- right?
- masters
- channels
- add-master <master>
- remove-master <master>
- join-channel <channel>
- part-channel
